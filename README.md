# Lost Ark Daily Tracker

Looking to build a daily tracker for all of your Lost Ark characters with interactivity. No more simple checklists that don't take into consideration your ilvl or your focus for each character.

## Planned MVP

- Inputs for character name, ilvl, class
- Add more characters
- Simple extenisve checklist for each character separately (See https://bit.ly/3hUkbhg for an example)
- Separate Roster checklist
- Automatic Daily and Weekly Reset
- Decent looking CSS

## Current Planned Feature List (To be Implemented)

- Daily and Weekly Reset Times - Customizable
- Character Planner
- Import class icons
- Menu to switch characters
- Automatic tracker for Procyon's Compass Events
- Reorganize character checklist for priority order
- ilvl automatically displays "default" available content
- Options to turn specific content on or off, per character basis
- Rename Daily/Weekly Una's to reflect which ones each character does for the day
- Availability to Import/Export Data










## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
